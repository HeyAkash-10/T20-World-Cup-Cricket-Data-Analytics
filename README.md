# T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics

### Project Overview

* This project aims to identify the top player for a T20 cricket team based on various
parameters relevant to their roles in the team. The data for this analysis was scraped
from ESPNcricinfo with a Brightdata website tool, cleaned, and transformed using pandas,
and then visualized using Power BI.

* Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories(Openers,
Middle Order, Finishers, Lower Order, and Fast Bowlers) for choosing the top 11 players
to play in the match.
